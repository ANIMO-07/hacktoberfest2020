Sorry, this repo has been closed for being misused by non first-timers to get easy PRs
in order to earn the free Hacktoberfest Tshirt. This was originally created to teach 
IIT Mandi students how GitHub works and help them lear the basics. That purpose has
been served and any new PRs might get declined. I hope you continue to work for
open source though and the readme.md file shall remain for people who might find the 
mentioned links useful. Thanks, Wakanda Forever.
